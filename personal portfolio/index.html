                        <li><span> graduated from XYZ University three months ago with a bachelorâ€™s in English and a 3.9 GPA. My English degree gave me strong communication and writing skills, which are crucial for event planning. But while I was in school, I got a lot of hands-on event planning experience from extracurriculars, too. I was in an improv group, where I ran all the social media accounts. My efforts boosted attendance at our shows by 15%. I also served as the recruitment chair for my fraternity, organizing and executing our annual fundraising and recruitment events. While we got about 50 applications each year before, we got 72 in my first year in-role and 90 the year after that.</li>
